ai(diff):-

ml:-
int,float,str,float.
01


dl:-
img,video,audio,signal.
01,+{layer}



image processing:-

first wwe will give a picture and then it will convert that image into 0 and 1 it will process that that image and then gives the output 
and this process is also called as encryption and decreption process. it is a grid technology.

VIDEO PROCESSING:-
SAME AS IMAGE PROCESSING.

AUDIO PROCESSING:-
SAME AS IMAGEPROCESSING. IT TALES IN A WAVE FORMAT.


3D CAD-
 IT IS USED IN SUBWAY SUFER GAME LIKE THE BOY IS RUNNING IN THE SAME PLACE. ONLY THE BACKGROUND IS MOVING.


cientific and numeric)
AI it has two types ML and DL
In ML it takes string,integer,float,etc..it convert 0 and 1 easily  in str it converted using NPL

In DL it takes image,video,audio ,signal it convert  0 and 1 with (layers) with the process name Grid
In this grid process it marks the the image is present then (1) otherwise (0) in graph

From input to output =encode and encryption 
From output to input=decode and decryption
 (Audio and video)
In audio call it takes only audio 
but in vc it takes both frequency ,sound, visual 
(3D cad)
Whereas temple run is a 2D game it was move in single place
This 3D cad are mostly used by the civil engineers for constrction
(Enterprise application)
It is used for entrepreneur for developing the product
